<p>
We want to get a sailboat (a type of Unmanned Surface Vehicle, or USV) through a canal autonomously. The maneuver
will be performed in a simulation environment with simulated wind as the propellant for the
USV. Environmental disturbances (water currents) will also be an important factor. This work has useful implications because it
allows the deployment of navigating,
energy-efficient and green-energy sailing boats that can withstand some environmental disturbances and only use
abundant wind energy to propel themselves. These boats could be used in sea monitoring, oceanic measurement, as drifting databuouys,
as survey ships etc. This can reduce expenses and reduce deployment time, and increase data resolution.

The maneuver will be performed in USWsim simulation environment, with simulated wind as the
propellantfor the USV. Environmental disturbances (water currents) are also be an important factor.


<p> We use code from here to simulate environmental disturbances: https://github.com/disaster-robotics-proalertas/usv_sim_lsa
  such as waves.

<h4> Conclusion </h4>
<p>
(a) Summarize your results, difficulties encountered, things you would have changed, and
possible future directions.
<p>
The simulation was run in several different cases. Waves,obstacles, and different wind vectors were
 used. The tests were not exhaustive due to the wide variety of environmental conditions possible at sea
  and also due to the limitations of the simulator. An experiment was deemed successful if the sailboat got
   close to the target position.

   The results demonstrated that the planner was largely successful. Obstacles as close 4 meters were navigated around. Any narrower gaps
   caused the planner to return an infeasible path. We used:
   A. Single Obstacle To demonstrate that the path planning and control scheme worked,
    the target position was set to(100,40,π/4) with wind the in the direction of the intended heading, shown in Fig.3.
    The wind had a magnitude of18 023 481 908 m/s. The boat was able tosail around the obstacle.B. ChannelBecause the
    obstacle avoidance worked without a dis-turbance, waves were added to the channel traversal experiment C.
    CrosswindsThe path planner was then tested with different winddirectionsThe experiment was run with a
    different wind direction.Note that the sailboat overshoots the target. This was deemed acceptable because
     stopping a sailboat at a point is another issue
